# The Spots App

This app is designed for exchanging locations of abandoned places to one another using the marker system implemented using Firebase. It is currently in Alpha with plans on continuing in the near future. The progress shown is from 1 month into development. From the time our group developed this app, we worked with nothing having to learn all of the API, a new language called Dart, and to constantly figure out how to merge our work with one another as it was also our first group coding project ever. This app will hopefully be worked on in the near future again with plans on making a fully working trade page for marker data with each unique user. While this project was stressful at times, our group enjoyed learning the future of app development which is Flutter.
